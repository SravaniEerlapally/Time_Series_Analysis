1.What is Time Series Data?
A) Observations collected over a time intervals i.e monthly, weekly, daily, seconds.
     Eg: Stock data, sales data, weather data, social media activity
 CHARACTERISTICS:
 ==> Chronological Order (regular intervals)
 ==> Sequential Order (cuurent obs depends on past )
 ==> Temporal Components ( trend, seasonality, cycle, noise)
 ==> Constant Frequency (continuous data without any missing value)
 ==> Dynamic Nature (affected by external factors)
 BEFORE PERFORMING TSA, these all should satisfy if not we need to change.

2.TIME SERIES ANALAYSIS
   - Its a statistical technique i.e used to extract meaningful insights about patterns and trends.
 Steps in TSA:
  i) Understand the past data
 ii) Forecating Future
Charts we prefer are Line Chart and Candle stick Chart[For Stocks(in 1 chart high,low, open,close)]
To compare with other data with same domain , unit we can plot in same and compare with multiple lines

3.TIME SERIES DECOMPOSITION
   ->Trend: Long Term Direction of Data [/Upward][\Downward]
   ->Seasonaity: Repeating patterns(similar) in fixed intervals
   ->Cycle(not fixed)
       ::>Economic
       ::>Business
   ->Residual (Noise): Sudden or random fluctuation

4.Types Of Decomposition
         --->1.Additive yt = Tt+St+Rt
         --->2.Multiplicative yt = Tt*St*Rt

 STL(Seasonal & Trend) Decomposition using LOESS(Locally Estimated Scatterplot Smoothening)
   - best method to handle outliers in time series data
   key diff
   Classical Decomposition                                                           STL Decompositon
  - fixed seasonal pattern                                     - variety seasonal pattern
  - easily influenced by outliers                              - handles outliers
  - handle both additive & multiplicative timeseries data      - only handle additive timeseries data

:: When TSD is based on additive model we use STL Decomposition , or if its based multiplicative we use CLASSICAL Decomposition

5.Stationarity
  If Mean, Variance, Auto-Correlation of any time series data are constant.
  Constant Mean i.e No trend

Q) Why do we need stationarity in TSD>
A) Helps in future forecasting easier because it assumes same statistical properties through the time.
   Forecasting models requires a stationary data
  Types Of Stationarity
     i) Weak Stationarity
          Constant mean, variance, auto-correlation.
          Joint Distribution can change.
        Use Case: For different Forecating model picking shorter period of data
    ii) Strict Stationarity
           Exhibits the properties of Weak Stationarity.
           Joint Distribution remains unchanged when shifted along any time period. 
          Use Case: Modelling entire distribution of data such that forecasting will be closure to actual values.

6.Testing For Stationarity
  i)Weak
     -ADF Test
     -KPSS Test
